# Code Challenge
Please follow these instructions for the code challenge. Ideally, you should spend about 30 minutes on the challenge and no more than an hour. You can use the custom.css file in the css folder to add your CSS changes and you can use the custom.js file in the js folder to add any JavaScript code. Feel free to be creative!

## Downloading Files
Click on the "clone or download" button and select "download zip". Unzip the folder and open in your favorite text editor.

Alternatively, you can use git to clone the repo. Click on the "clone or download" button and copy the URL. CD into the directory that you want to save the folder in and run:

```
git clone <URL>
```

## Instructions
1. Replace the "company" text in the navbar with the logo image in the img folder. Please note there are two files, a dark and a light logo. You can use CSS or JavaScript to change the logo from light to dark when the user scrolls down. HINT: Look at any class name changes for the nav element in Chrome dev tools.
2. Change the website colors to match the logo.
3. When a user clicks on the "read bio" button under "meet our CEO", a modal should pop up with the CEO's bio. HINT: Take a look at the Bootstrap documentation for adding a modal [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/components/modal/](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/components/modal/) 

You can use this Lorem ipsum text for the bio:

```
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Animi suscipit fugit, quaerat consequuntur quam hic enim nisi nesciunt omnis atque iure, ipsum numquam sunt velit dolores, neque. Atque, veritatis, quisquam. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Asperiores dolores, velit quo, dignissimos assumenda voluptates expedita. Fugiat perferendis maiores tempore debitis aut illo distinctio quidem, laborum, quasi ea at dignissimos. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Maiores nam repellendus aperiam, eius accusamus voluptatibus, natus saepe culpa neque earum officia molestias quisquam, reprehenderit sed. Sunt voluptatum nemo sit quidem.
```

4. Under "get in touch", add an address: 100 Main St New York, NY 10001. It should be in line with the phone number and email. HINT: The map marker icon class for Font Awesome is "fas fa-map-marker"
